**WHY WAFFLE WEDNESDAY?**

In a world of polished posts and curated content, Waffle Wednesday brings back authenticity. Wednesday is the middle of the week - the perfect time to check in, share how things are really going, and connect with the people who matter.

Voice is powerful. It carries emotion, personality, and nuance that text can never capture. With Waffle Wednesday, you'll hear the excitement in your friend's voice when they share good news, or the exhaustion after a tough week.

• Staying connected with distant friends and family
• Building community around shared experiences
• Taking a midweek pause to reflect and share
• People who prefer talking over typing
• Anyone tired of superficial social media

**PRIVACY & SAFETY**

• Your data belongs to you
• Choose what you share: friends only or public
• Sign in securely with Apple
• No ads, no algorithms, no engagement tricks
• Delete your content anytime

Start your Wednesday tradition today. Your friends are waiting to hear from you.
